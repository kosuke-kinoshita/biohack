# Hello, this is Kosuke
I am participated in the launch of "<a href="https://mtrl.com/">MTRL</a> (Material)," which supports co-creation and innovation of manufacturing companies with materials as a starting point, and "<a href="https://fabcafe.com/kyoto/">FabCafe Kyoto</a>," a community base where diverse creators, researchers, and companies gather with technology and creation as keywords. 
Through the management of online/offline workshops and the production of exhibition projects, I am currently practicing "creating a place where chemical reactions occur" and "contextual design that connects things from different fields.

# What is Life?
I personally define "life" as follows. (this would not necessarily be correct...)
<li>It finally "dies" and ceases to exist as an individual.</li>
<li>It changes its behavior in response to external factors.</li>
<li>It consumes some energy just to exist.</li>
